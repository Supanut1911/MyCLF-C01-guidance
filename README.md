### ðŸŸ¦ Cloud Concept

    â—† 6 advantage of cloud
      - Reliability                        -> ** "Stop guress capacity" **
      - Agility, Elasticity, Scalability   -> ** "Increase speed" **
      - Pay-as-you-go                      -> ** "Stop overspend to data-center" **
                                           -> ** "Trad fix expense" **
                                           -> ** "Economic of scale" **
      - reach global                       -> ** "Fast to reach a global" **


    â—† economic of scale
      - No Capex, less Opex
      - reduce labor cost
      - license

    â—† AWS Architecture & Ecosystem
      - AWS well-architecture framework with 6 pillar
        - Cost optimizte        -> pay as use
        - Performance           -> select right compute resource
        - Security              -> protect info (encrypt)
        - Reliability           -> recover fast (recover test, horizontal scale)
        - Operation excellence  -> (Reverse fault plan, anticipate fail)
        - Sustainability Pillar


      - Architect principle
        - Design for failure
        - Decouple
        - Elastic
        - Think parallel
        - Automation
